Markdown: Basics: Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by looking at a few examples of it in action

Paragraph
---------
A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines.

life is beautiful, try to make it more more beautiful.

Headings
========
put 1-6 hash marks (#) at the beginning of the line — the number of hashes equals the resulting HTML header level.

###### 6 hashes `######`
##### 5 hashes `#####`
#### 4 hashes `####`
### 3 hashes `###`
## 2 hashes `##`
# 1 hashes `#`

> Blockquotes are indicated using email-style `>` angle brackets.

Some of these words *are emphasized* using `*asterisks on both side*`.

Some of these words _are emphasized also_ using `_underscore_`.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis** using `**double asterisks**`.

Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__ using `__double underscore__`.

# List
> Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*, +, and -`) as list markers. These three markers are interchangable; this:

* Life `*`
* Death `*`

+ Truth `+`
+ Lie `+`

- Inside `-`
- Outside `-`

> Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as list markers:

1. Sunday `1. `
2. Monday `2. `

# Links
Markdown supports two styles for creating links: inline and reference. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the text you want to turn into a link.

Let's share something on [emotionaldiary](http://emotionaldiary.com) : syntax is: `[name](link)`

# Code

In a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in backtick(button exactly below `esc` key) quotes

` #include<iostream.h> `

` # include<math.h> `
